# OSQA 
> Pronounced oska

On-Device Software Quality Assurance (OSQA). Software can and should be deterministic 

## How it works

- Load a software expected behaviour specification with verification steps
- Launch a quality assurance session
- Verify expected behaviour per test case
- Evaluate the quality assurance session results

## Configuration Options

- Minimum passed test cases
- Minimum passed test cases per module

OSQA is not persistent, data is only collected and maintained during a QA session, when the QA session is terminated, all data is deleted.
